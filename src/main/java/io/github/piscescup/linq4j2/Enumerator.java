/**
 * Represents a stateful forward-only enumerator over a sequence of elements.
 *
 * <p>This interface is conceptually similar to C#'s {@code IEnumerator<T>},
 * while also integrating with Java's {@link Iterator} contract.
 *
 * <p>The enumeration process follows this lifecycle:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Enumerator<T> e = ...;
 * while (e.moveNext()) {
 *     T element = e.current();
 *     // process element
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Unlike a standard {@link Iterator}, this interface explicitly separates:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #moveNext()} – advances the internal cursor</li>
 *     <li>{@link #current()} – returns the current element</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #hasNext()} and {@link #next()} methods are provided
 * for compatibility with Java's {@link Iterator} contract.
 *
 * <p>Implementations may optionally support:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #reset()} – restarting the enumeration</li>
 *     <li>{@link #close()} – releasing underlying resources</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Thread Safety:</b> Implementations are not required to be thread-safe.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of elements returned by this enumerator
