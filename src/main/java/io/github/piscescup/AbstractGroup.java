     *     {@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}
     *     or consistently return {@code false}, provided no

     *     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     *     application to another execution of the same application.
     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@link
     *     #equals(Object) equals} method, then calling the {@code
     *     hashCode} method on each of the two objects must produce the
     *     same integer result.
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
     *     according to the {@link #equals(Object) equals} method, then
     *     calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the two objects
     *     must produce distinct integer results.  However, the programmer
     *     should be aware that producing distinct integer results for
     *     unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @implSpec As far as is reasonably practical, the {@code hashCode} method defined
     * by class {@code Object} returns distinct integers for distinct objects.
     * @apiNote The {@link Objects#hash(Object...) hash} and {@link
     * Objects#hashCode(Object) hashCode} methods of {@link
